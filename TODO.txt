TODO
(*) Geom updating with glSubBufferData
(*) Removing unneccessary vec._mod changes


NOTES
(*) appended C on a function name means this function creates copies of working
    primitives / vecs instead of using by-reference, thus creating independent
    new objects which will not be affected by any change but to themself

    e.g.: v1.addVecC v2 returns a new Vec = (v1 + v2)
	  line.coloredLineSegC [..] returns a line segement which is
	  independent of the line itself

(*) vec.asHom is intended for 3-dim vectors to be interpreted as (v, 1.0) in
    homogeneous coord. space and should only be used if neccessary

    e.g.: graphical interpretation of a polygon, defined as list of 3-dim
    	  vectors, which should change in accordance to a change of the
	  polygon itself
