(*) Fix the problem that after one call in moveOntoCircle the dir-vec
    gets changed because the point moves from the line hence not going into if
(*) Scale Polygons in plane

Geometry
--
(*) Non-poly to poly connections
(*) Smaller poly from poly via point-check (i.e. take parts of side and compl)
(*) when modifying connected polygons, reconnect if better match available

(*) [difficult] Smoother, tesselated poly-poly connections
(*) [difficult math] Smaller poly from poly via inside-circle

(*) Particles
(*) Some form of shadows
(*) Remove Datasets
